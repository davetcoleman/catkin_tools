Testing
=======

The `catkin_tools` test harness includes the following
types of tests, organized into different directories:

* **unit** -- API tests for the `catkin_tools` python interface
* **integrated** -- Full integration tests for different workflows
* **system** -- Tests which not only test integrated parts of catkin_tools but the interaction with other, external projects like catkin_pkg and catkin.
